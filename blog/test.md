## The Science Behind Global Warming

### The Greenhouse Effect

#### How It Works

---

![Greenhouse Effect Diagram](https://example.com/greenhouse-effect.jpg "400px") {ref: img-greenhouse-effect-diagram} {cap: A diagram showing how greenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere.}

---

:::list
- The natural greenhouse effect:
  - Keeps Earth’s surface warm enough to sustain life.
- Enhanced greenhouse effect:
  - Human activities increase greenhouse gas concentrations, trapping more heat.
  - Major contributors:
    - Burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas)
    - Industrial processes
    - Agricultural practices
:::

---

:::collapse
The Role of Carbon Dioxide (CO2)
CO2 is the most significant greenhouse gas emitted by human activities. It is primarily released through:
- Burning fossil fuels for energy.
- Deforestation, which reduces CO2 absorption by trees.
- Cement production and other industrial processes.

$$ {ref: math-global-warming-impact}
The rate of temperature increase can be approximated by:
\[
\Delta T = \frac{\alpha \cdot (C - C_0)}{1 + \beta \cdot (C - C_0)}
\]
Where:
- \(\Delta T\): Change in temperature.
- \(C\): Current CO2 concentration.
